----------
About:
Solves a sudoku puzzle using a look-ahead backtracking algorithm.

----------
How to Use:
After downloading the source, run as follows:

$ python sudokuSolver.py

sudokuSolver expects input from STDIN. So either redirect an input file or type in a board manually. See input format for details.

----------
Input Format:
The expected input is 81 individual numbers between 0 and 9 inclusive. 1 - 9 are valid board numbers, while 0 represents an empty cell.
The numbers can be separated by spaces or newlines. For readability, it is best to write in a similar format to a sudoku puzzle like so:

1 3 8 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 1 2 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
3 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Or without spaces, if preferred. See textFiles directory for example input.

Future features:
Will include test files for each function.
